<h4>This Content about difference between Document and Window Object</h4>
<p>The Document Object in web development represents the entire HTML document and provides methods to manipulate its content and structure. It serves as an interface for interacting with elements such as text, images, and links within a webpage.

On the other hand, the Window Object represents the browser window or tab and serves as the global object for JavaScript in the browser. It provides properties and methods for managing the browser environment, such as navigating to URLs, handling events, and interacting with the browser's history.

In summary, the Document Object deals specifically with the content and structure of an HTML document, while the Window Object manages the overall browser environment and provides control over the browser window or tab.</p>
